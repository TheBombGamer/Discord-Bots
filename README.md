# Discord-Bots
A collective of fully functional python discord bots with comments for starters, comes with instructional videos for some of the bots, in a atempt to help people learn more about discord.py, and bring education of this package to a simpler level, possibly even down to the level that a 6th to 12th grader could all understand, I will be making videos later in the year closer to march! stay tuned in to watch those, i will also be posting a wiki for quick bits you can start off with, such as a piece of sample code with errors in it that the user has to solve! no matter what happens i wish everyone the best of luck on their coding journeys!
